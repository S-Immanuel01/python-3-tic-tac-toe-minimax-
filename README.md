# python-3-tic-tac-toe-using-minimax-algorithm
The Minimax Algorithm is a recursive decision making algorithm. In the code I used the Minimax algorithm to help my Artificail Intelligent player to decide where to play next.

## How it works 
The minimax algorithm uses recursion to test every possibility of the game and picks the optimal path for a definite win. Ofcourse all this is done with the Assumption that the human player is also playing optimally to Maximize his score and minimize the AI player score.
